# Linear-Regression-
Linear regression using one variable in machine learning 
# Overview
Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one independent variable (feature). The goal is to find the best-fitting straight line (also called the regression line) that predicts the target variable based on the input feature.
# Equation
The equation of the linear regression model with one variable is:
h(x)=mx+c
Where:
h(x): The predicted value (also referred to as the output or target).
m:  The slope of the line, representing how much h(x) changes for a unit change in x
c:The intercept (bias term), representing the value of h(x) when x=0
x: The independent variable (feature).
# Goal
​J(m,c)=1/2m * summition of input x (h(x)-y)**2
Where:
m: The number of training examples.
y:Target label or output
x:Are the input columns
# Interpretation
m (Slope):Determines the direction and steepness of the regression line. A positive slope means that as x increases,h(x) also increases. A negative slope means that as x increases,h(x) decreases.
c (Intercept): Indicates where the line crosses the y-axis, which is the predicted value when x=0
